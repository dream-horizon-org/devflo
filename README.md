# daisdlc

AI Software Development Lifecycle for [Cursor](https://cursor.com). Installs a complete set of rules, agents, commands, and skills into any project's `.cursor/` directory via a single CLI command.

## What's Included

| Category | Files | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Rules** | `ai-sdlc-workflow.mdc`, `must-follow.mdc` | Enforces the full SDLC lifecycle with approval gates, and coding standards (DRY, linting, test-first, 800-line limit) |
| **Agents** | `pm-agent.md`, `architect-agent.md`, `dev-agent.md`, `qa-agent.md` | Specialized agents for Product Management, Architecture, Development (TDD), and QA Review |
| **Commands** | `daisdlc.md`, `daisdlc-plan.md`, `daisdlc-design.md`, etc. | Slash commands for driving individual SDLC phases or the full lifecycle explicitly |
| **Skills** | `documentation-steward`, `reuse-before-write` | Automates OpenSpec documentation lifecycle and enforces reuse-first development |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- A GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with `read:packages` scope, or membership in the `dream-horizon-org` GitHub organization

## Setup

### 1. Configure the GitHub Packages registry

Create or edit `~/.npmrc` in your home directory and add:

```
@dream-horizon-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with a GitHub PAT that has `read:packages` scope.

### 2. Install globally

```bash
npm install -g @dream-horizon-org/daisdlc
```

## Usage

### Initialize a project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
daisdlc init
```

This copies all SDLC rules, agents, commands, and skills into your project's `.cursor/` directory.

You can also specify a path:

```bash
daisdlc init ./path/to/project
```

### Update to the latest version

When a new version of daisdlc is published, upgrade and update your project:

```bash
npm update -g @dream-horizon-org/daisdlc
daisdlc update
```

The `update` command checks the installed version against the package version and only copies files if there's a newer version available.

## What happens when you run `daisdlc init`

```

        │   └── SKILL.md
        └── reuse-before-write/
            └── SKILL.md
```

Existing files in `.cursor/` that don't conflict with daisdlc files are left untouched. Files with the same name are overwritten.

## Commands

daisdlc installs Cursor slash commands that let you drive the SDLC pipeline explicitly. Type `/` in the Cursor chat input to see all available commands.

### Two ways to use the SDLC

1. **Automatic (rule-based):** Just describe your request in chat. The `ai-sdlc-workflow.mdc` rule automatically classifies it, selects the pipeline, and orchestrates phases in sequence with approval gates.

2. **Manual (command-driven):** Use the `/daisdlc-*` commands to invoke each phase yourself. This gives you full control over when each phase runs, and works across chat sessions since state is persisted in `status.yaml` inside the OpenSpec change workspace.

### Full lifecycle command

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/daisdlc <request>` | Run the complete SDLC pipeline from classification through delivery. Equivalent to the automatic rule, but invoked explicitly. Useful when the rule doesn't apply or you want to guarantee the full lifecycle runs. |

### Individual phase commands

Run phases one at a time, in any chat session. Each command checks prerequisites before proceeding.

| Command | Phase | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/daisdlc-plan <request>` | Plan | Classifies the request, creates the OpenSpec change workspace, and invokes the PM Agent to produce a requirements brief. Stops at the **PM APPROVED** gate. |
| `/daisdlc-design <change-name>` | Design | Invokes the Architect Agent to produce `design.md` and `tasks.md`. Requires PM approval. Stops at the **ARCH APPROVED** gate. |
| `/daisdlc-implement <change-name> [task]` | Implement | Invokes the Developer Agent for a specific task using strict TDD. Requires Architect approval. If no task number is given, presents the task list for selection. |
| `/daisdlc-audit <change-name>` | Audit | Invokes the QA Agent to review the implementation against OpenSpec artifacts. Reports pass/fail with categorized findings. |
| `/daisdlc-deliver <change-name>` | Deliver | Runs the final test summary, integration verification, produces the delivered change summary, and appends to `DELIVERED.md`. |

### Utility command

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/daisdlc-status [change-name]` | Shows the current phase status of a specific change, or lists all active changes. Suggests the next command to run. |

### Example: manual workflow

```
# Session 1 — Plan
/daisdlc-plan Add rate limiting to the API
→ PM Brief produced, awaiting approval
PM APPROVED

# Session 2 — Design
/daisdlc-design add-rate-limiting
→ Design + task list produced, awaiting approval
ARCH APPROVED

# Session 3 — Implement + Audit
/daisdlc-implement add-rate-limiting 1
→ Task 1 implemented with TDD
/daisdlc-audit add-rate-limiting
→ QA passed

# Session 4 — Deliver
/daisdlc-implement add-rate-limiting 2
→ Task 2 implemented
/daisdlc-audit add-rate-limiting
→ QA passed
/daisdlc-deliver add-rate-limiting
→ Change delivered
```

### Bundled OpenSpec commands

daisdlc bundles the [OpenSpec CLI](https://openspec.dev/) as a dependency. No separate installation is needed. All OpenSpec commands are available via `daisdlc spec`:

```bash
daisdlc spec init --tools none
daisdlc spec change create <name>
daisdlc spec change generate-templates <name>
daisdlc spec change archive <name>
daisdlc spec validate
daisdlc spec status --json
```

Any OpenSpec command works — `daisdlc spec` forwards all arguments to the bundled OpenSpec binary.

> **Migration note:** If you previously ran `openspec <cmd>` directly, replace it with `daisdlc spec <cmd>`.

### State management

Commands persist state in `openspec/changes/<change-name>/status.yaml`, which tracks:

- Classification and pipeline
- Phase statuses (pending, in_progress, complete, approved, pass, fail)
- Gate approvals with timestamps
- Task completion progress

This enables **cross-session resumability** — start a change in one chat, continue it in another. Run `/daisdlc-status` at any time to see where you left off.

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# One-time setup
echo '@dream-horizon-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com' >> ~/.npmrc
echo '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN' >> ~/.npmrc
npm install -g @dream-horizon-org/daisdlc

# In any project
cd your-project
daisdlc init
```

```

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dream-horizon-org/daisdlc.git
cd daisdlc
npm install
npm run build
```

### Editing Rules, Agents, Commands, or Skills

The canonical source for SDLC content lives in `.cursor/` at the project root. Edit files there, then sync them to `templates/cursor/` before publishing:

```bash
npm run sync-templates
```

This is also run automatically as part of `prepublishOnly`, so you don't need to remember it when publishing.

### Building

```bash
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run clean       # Remove dist/
```

### Publishing a New Version

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To publish a new version:

1. **Push your changes** to the `main` branch (or your default branch).

2. **Create and push a version tag.** The tag determines the published package version:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

   The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Set the package version from the tag
   - Build the project
   - Publish to GitHub Packages

3. **Verify** the package appears at:
   `https://github.com/orgs/dream-horizon-org/packages/npm/daisdlc`

There is no need to manually bump the version in `package.json` -- the workflow extracts it from the git tag.

### Version Tagging Convention

Tags must start with `v` followed by a valid semver version:

| Tag | Published Version |
|-----|-------------------|
| `v0.1.0` | `0.1.0` |
| `v1.0.0` | `1.0.0` |
| `v2.3.1` | `2.3.1` |
